# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains proof-of-concept prototypes for SkillChamber, an AI-powered language learning platform. A multi‑agent learning engine that turns subject‑matter expertise into adaptive conversational simulations. It powers ready‑made apps (e.g., LingoStand) and white‑label solutions for partners who want measurable skill growth through realistic practice, targeted feedback, and teacher/manager insights.

## Goal

The goal of the repository is to generate POCS that help create MVPs within the platform. 

It contains business and product documents

The repository with the actual codebase of the plaform is `https://github.com/ernesto-butto/skill-chamber`
